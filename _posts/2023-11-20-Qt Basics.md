# QT Basics
(I assume that you have setep qt with QT creator)

## New Project
1. File -> New Project -> Application(Qt) -> Qt Console Application
2. Give a Project name. I will name my first project pets.
3. Choose CMake for building.

## Check 
## Moc and Qobject

### MOC (Meta Object Compiler)
Before the C++ code is compiled, the MOC comes in and adds some code by replacing the QT code like macros (Q_Object) , signal and slots as these stuff are not a part of C++.


### Q_Object
When a new QObject class is created, in the header file of the class a you will have some thing called Q_OBJECT, this is where MOC will come and add some code afterwards, and this is what will make a QObject a QObject.
